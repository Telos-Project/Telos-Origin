# Telos Origin

## 1 - Abstract

***Locked and Loaded.***

Telos Origin is an [APInt](https://github.com/Telos-Project/APInt) portal which loads plugins
listed in an environmental APInt into a [bus net](https://github.com/Telos-Project/Bus-Net) based
application.

If using a CLI, the application shall allow the user to install and uninstall APInts as
sub-packages of the common APInt.

In this manner, it acts as a bootstrapping platform for an innumerable variety of highly complex
and modular applications.
